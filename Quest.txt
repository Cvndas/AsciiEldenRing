Quest: Remake the ELDEN RING ASCII game, and expand on it greatly. 

# +++ ___ +++ ___ ASCII Elden Ring ___ +++ ___ +++ #

A remake of an ASCII game I made 2 years ago. 

    HOME SCREEN:
When booting the game, you are presented with two 3 options:
1. Continue
2. Load
3. New Game

4. Section: "A Game By Eidas.\n" Game is tested on Linux and MacOS using the Alacritty terminal emulator.\n
             Other terminals may have worse performance.\n"

    NEW GAME:
What is your name?
Choose your class: b (bandit), a (archer), 

    GAMEPLAY MODES:
Overworld & Combat

    OVERWORLD:

A top-down view of a game world, where each grid area takes up one character. Enemies
are marked and have colors. There are items to collect, chests to open, shops to buy 
new gear, new weapons, new armor.

The world consists of Limgrave, Liunia, Altus. Explored in linear fashion. Each area has an overworld, and then a legacy
dungeon where you need to find keys and solve minor puzzles to get to the boss. 

    INVENTORY SYSTEM:

When in the overworld AND when in combat, pressing i brings up the inventory menu. 

    LOADING, SAVING
When pressing P, you open up the Pause menu, from where you can save your progress and
exit the game. The game also auto-saves when resting at a bonfire, when dying, and when collecitng a new weapon. When lo

IT's saved in either a JSON file, or INI file, depending on what works best with C++. 

    UI
On top of the screen, you have one line that has the controls, which doesn't update until you switch
Gameplay mode (Overworld | Combat | Inventory | Shop | etc.)
Below that is a line
-------------------
Then there is the Status bar. This bar can be filled with information that is relevant to recently taken actions, and remains
there for either 5 seconds, in a specified color, or is replaced if another action takes it over. 

    STATUS BAR EXAMPLES
1. PUSH BLOCK (space) | BLUE |
2. YOU TRIED TO SWIM IN LAVA | RED | (character will flash red a couple of times) 
3. RUNES RETRIEVED | GOLD | 
4. GAME SAVED | WHITE | 
5. 


The entire screen is surrounded by a border, to indicate how large the terminal screen needs to be for the game to function. 

    TECHNICAL DETAILS
1. Control scheme always visible on the top of the screen, mode dependent
2. Screen borders are drawn, so you know if the terminal size is great enough.

    COMBAT:
You can equip both a melee weapon as well as a ranged weapon. 

    LEVELING:
You can level up your:
1. Health
2. Melee Damage
3. Ranged Damage
Leveling requires more 

    RETRIEVING SOULS:
Your soul will be marked on the map on the spot where you last died. 
When you reach your soul, the Status Bar states: RUNES RETRIEVED
